	<h1><b>FIGHTER</b></h1>
	<p class = "intro">
		Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, 
		or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and 
		prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many 
		weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying 
		the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors 
		reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, 
		slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters 
		are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.

 sheer battle prowess.
