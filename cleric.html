	<h1><b>CLERIC</b></h1>
	<p class = "intro">
		<img src="images/Cleric.png" alt="Cleric">In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal 
		understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more 
		than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms 
		and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these 
		ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar 
		abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and 
		redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric 
		are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods 
		themselves.
	</p>
	<p class="role">
Role: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable 
combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase
 their own and their allies’ prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in 
 need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the 
 vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of 
 devotion—such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge—free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this 
 path to selecting a specific deity.)
