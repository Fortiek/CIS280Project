		Hello, and welcome to the Pathfinder v1.0 character builder for beginners! With this tool you'll be able to get an 
		idea how a character is built from the ground up! In the banner, you'll find links to different character classes
		that will help you fill in the blanks after determining some character basics like your attributes, (Which you'll 
		determine with a POINT BUY system.) and your race! Thank you for trying out the game, and hopefully this tool will 
		help you jump in feet first so you can get to playing with your friends!
