		Hello, and welcome to the Pathfinder v1.0 character builder for beginners! With this tool you'll be able to get an 
		idea how a character is built from the ground up! In the banner, you'll find links to different character classes
		that will help you fill in the blanks after determining some character basics like your attributes, (Which you'll 
		determine with a POINT BUY system.) and your race! Thank you for trying out the game, and hopefully this tool will 
		help you jump in feet first so you can get to playing with your friends!

		<p id="dwarf_info">
			Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot 
			shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that
			account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves 
			pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men 
			often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and 
			intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure
			sign of madness, or worse—no one familiar with their race
			trusts a beardless dwarven man.
		</p>
		<p id="elf_info">
			Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, 
			slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed 
			ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or
			feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising
			power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with
			large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves as
			a whole varies wildly, and is much more diverse than that of 
			human populations. However, as their coloration often 
			matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community
			may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have 
			variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and 
			even skin tones.
			While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the 
			natural world, those elves who live in cities tend to bedec
			themselves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling elves 
			encounter other urbanites, the elves are often fashion 
			trendsetters.
		</p>
		<p id="gnome_info">
			Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, 
			generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Despite 
			their small frames, however, gnomes are extremely resilient, 
			and not as weak as many of their foes assume. Though their 
			diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, 
			gnomes often train to take advantage of their size,
			especially when fighting foes much larger than themselves.
			The coloration of gnomes varies so wildly that many 
			outsiders assume gnomes commonly use dyes and illusions to 
			change their skin and hair tones. While gnomes are certainly
			not above cosmetic enhancement (and may wish to change their
			appearance just to see how outlandish they can look), 
			their natural hues truly range over a rainbow of coloration.
			Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery 
			orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at
			springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wildflowers in 
			bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy 
			browns to floral pinks, and gnomes with black, pastel blue, 
			or even green skin are not unknown. Gnomes’ coloration has
			little regard for heredity, with the color of a gnome’s
			parents and other kin having no apparent bearing on the
			gnome’s appearance. Gnomes possess highly mutable facial
			characteristics, and their proportions often don’t match 
			the norm of other humanoid races. Many have overly large 
			mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and 
			stunning, depending on the individual. Others may have 
			extremely small features spread over an otherwise blank 
			expanse of face, or may mix shockingly large eyes with a 
			tiny, pursed mouth and a pert button of a nose. Gnomes
			rarely take pride in or show embarrassment about their
			features, but members of other races often fixate on a 
			gnome’s most prominent feature and attempt to use it as the 
			focus of insults or endearments.
		</p>
		<p id="halfelf_info">
			 Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. 
			 They inherit the lean build and comely features of their
			 elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by 
			 their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears
			 of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. 
			 Their eyes tend to be human-like in shape, but feature an
			 exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald 
			 green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-elves of 
			 drow descent, however. Such elves are almost unfailingly 
			 marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, 
			 and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on 
			 a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their 
			 eye color usually favors that of the human parent.
		</p>
		<p id="halforc_info">
			Half-orcs average around 6 feet tall, with powerful builds 
			and greenish or grayish skin. Their canine teeth often grow 
			long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these 
			“tusks,” combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed 
			ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While 
			half-orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as 
			beautiful. Despite these obvious orc traits, half-orcs are
			as varied as their human parents.
		</p>
		<p id="halfling_info">
			 Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet. They prefer to 
			 walk barefoot, leading the bottoms of their feet to become 
			 roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops 
			 of their broad, tanned feet.Their skin tends toward a rich 
			 cinnamon color and their hair toward light shades of brown. 
			 A halfling’s ears are pointed, but proportionately not much
			 larger than those of a human.Halflings prefer simple and
			 modest clothing. Though willing and able to dress up if the 
			 situation demands it, their racial urge to remain quietly 
			 in the background makes them rather conservative dressers 
			 in most situations. Halfling entertainers, on the other 
			 hand, make their livings by drawing attention, and tend to 
			 go overboard with gaudy and flashy costumes.
		</p>
		<p id="human_info">
			The physical characteristics of humans are as varied as the 
			world’s climes. From the dark-skinned tribesmen of the 
			southern continents to the pale and barbaric raiders of the 
			northern lands, humans possess a wide variety of skin 
			colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, 
			humans’ skin color assumes a darker hue the closer to the 
			equator they live. At the same time, bone structure, hair 
			color and texture, eye color, and a host of facial and 
			bodily phenotypic characteristics vary immensely from one 
			locale to another. Cheekbones may be high or broad, noses 
			aquiline or flat, and lips full or thin; eyes range wildly 
			in hue, some deep set in their sockets, and others with full 
			epicanthic folds. Appearance is hardly random, of course, 
			and familial, tribal, or national commonalities often allow 
			the knowledgeable to identify a human’s place of origin on
			sight, or at least to hazard a good guess. Humans’ origins 
			are also indicated through their traditional styles of 
			bodily decoration, not only in the clothing or jewelry worn,
			but also in elaborate hairstyles, piercing, tattooing, and
			even scarification.
