	<h1><b>WIZARD</b></h1>
	<p class = "intro">
		Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends 
		of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible—such mysteries call to
		those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the
		wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders
		beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters 
		of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards
		prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to 
		their every desire.
	</p>
	<p class="role">
Role: While universalist wizards might study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research 
schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards
 are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger.
